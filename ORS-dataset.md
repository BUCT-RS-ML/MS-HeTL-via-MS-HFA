# ORS-datasets
# Introduction
The dataset contains eight ship classes  with a total of 8678 pictures. All pictures are collected using
Google Earth with sub-meter resolution and corresponding class information are matched with the official website[http://www.marinetraffic.com/]

The imagery slices in our dataset are segmented more carefully. Each slice contains only one ship, so the users can focus only on the evaluating of the
classification method, without the need to perform additional processing on the pictures. We sincerely hope that it becomes
a new data support for the community.
